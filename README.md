## :black_nib: Description

For the CSS to the Rescue course within the Minor Web Design & Development ([@cmda-minor-web](https://github.com/cmda-minor-web)) we learn more about the many possibilities of CSS. Everything that is made is built with only HTML and CSS.

This repository shows the project in which I transform the simple HTML structure of a **menu for a restaurant** into a beautiful web page. Here are a number of points that have been incorporated on the web page:
**Context:**

- Prefers-color-scheme
- Print-stylesheet

**Restrictions:**

- Two colors
- Responsive without media queries

To read the full process you can have a look at my [wiki]().
